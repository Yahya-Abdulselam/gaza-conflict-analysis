# Gaza Conflict Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes daily casualty data from the Gaza conflict, focusing on trends before and after a ceasefire date (March 10, 2024). The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, with visualizations and statistics to help understand the impact of the ceasefire and other events.

## Features
- Cleans and processes daily casualty data.
- Calculates and visualizes gaps between zero-casualty days.
- Compares trends before and after the ceasefire.
- Plots monthly deaths of medics, civil defense, and press workers.
- Uses clear, modular code with explanatory comments.

## How to Run
1. **Requirements:**
   - Python 3.x
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - numpy, matplotlib, datascience (install with `pip install numpy matplotlib datascience`)
2. **Open the Notebook:**
   - Open `ProjectPartB(final)(2).ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. **Run the Cells:**
   - Run each cell in order to reproduce the analysis and plots.

## File Structure
- `ProjectPartB(final)(2).ipynb`: Main analysis notebook.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Notes
- The code is well-commented for clarity. Each section explains its purpose and logic.
- The project focuses on simplicity and readability.
- All plots and statistics are generated within the notebook.
